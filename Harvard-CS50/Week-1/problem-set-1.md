# Problem Set 1

For this problem set, you’ll use CS50 Lab, a cloud-based programming environment with interactive instructions built atop [CS50 Sandbox](https://sandbox.cs50.io/). Start each problem (linked below) by watching the introduction video (if there is one) and then follow the instructions step by step, pressing the green `next` button as you move through the Lab. When you reach the end, the last step will be submitting your code.

## What to Do

1.  Submit [Hello](https://lab.cs50.io/cs50/labs/2019/x/hello/)
2.  Submit one of:
    - [this version of Mario](https://lab.cs50.io/cs50/labs/2019/x/mario/less/) if feeling less comfortable
    - [this version of Mario](https://lab.cs50.io/cs50/labs/2019/x/mario/more/) if feeling more comfortable
3.  Submit one of:
    - [Cash](https://lab.cs50.io/cs50/labs/2019/x/cash/) if feeling less comfortable
    - [Credit](https://lab.cs50.io/cs50/labs/2019/x/credit/) if feeling more comfortable

If you submit both Marios, we’ll record the higher of your two scores. If you submit both of Cash and Credit, we’ll record the higher of your two scores.

## Advice

- Try out any of David’s programs from class via Week 1’s [sandbox](https://sandbox.cs50.io/fbe800b2-4c6f-4bf4-8642-a853ee08ce5d).
- If you see any errors when compiling your code with `make`, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking `help50` for help. For instance, if trying to compile `hello`, and

  ```
  make hello

  ```

  is yielding errors, try running

  ```
  help50 make hello

  ```

  instead!

- Remember that your code will be graded for both correctness and style. You should test your program with various inputs for correctness. You should style your code per the [CS50 Style Guide](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/style/c/).
