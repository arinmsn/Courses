## Ch 4 Challenges

1.  Create a counting program that counts from 1 to 100 in increments of 5.

2.  Create a counting program that counts backwards from 100 to 1 in increments of 10.

3.  Create a counting program that prompts the user for three inputs (shown next) that determine
  how and what to count. Store the user's answers in variables. Use the acquired data to build 
  your counting program with a for loop and display the results to the user.

  * Beginning number to start counting from
  * Ending number to stop counting at
  * Increment number

4.  Create a math quiz program that prompts the user for how many questions to ask.
The program should congragulate the player if he or she gets the correct answer or 
alert the user of the correct answer in the event the question is answered incorrectly.
The math quiz program should aslo keep track of how many questions the player has answered
correctly and incorrectly and display these running totals at the end of the quiz.

5.  Modify the Concentration Game to use a main menu. The menu should alow the user to 
select a level of difficulty and/or quit the game (a sample menu is shown below). The level
of difficulty could be determined by how many seconds the player has to concentrate. Each
time the user completes a single game of Concentration, the menu should reappear allowing the 
user to continue at the same level, at a new level, or simply quit the game.
