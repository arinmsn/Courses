## Ch 3 Challenges

1.  Build a number guessing game that uses input validation (isdigit() function)
to verify that the user has entered a digit and not a non-digit (letter). Store
a random number between 1 and 10 into a variable each time the program is run.
Prompt the user to guess a number between 1 and 10 and alert the user if he was correct and not.

2.  Build a Fortune Cookie program that uses either the Chinese Zodiac or astrological signs to generate 
a fortune, a prediction, or a horoscope based on the user's input. More specifically, the user may 
need to input her year of birth, month of birth, and day of birth depending on zodiac or astrological
techniques used. With this information, generate a custom message or fortune. You can use the Internet
to find more information on the Chinese Zodaic or astrologly. 

3.  Create a dice game that uses two six-sided dice. Each time the program runs, use random numbers to assign
values to each die variable. Output a "player wins" message to the user if the sum of the two dice is 7 or 11.
Otherwise output the sum of the two dice and thank the user for playing.
