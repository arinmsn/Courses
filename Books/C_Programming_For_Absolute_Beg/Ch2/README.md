## Ch2 Challenges

1. Given a = 5, b = 1, x = 10, and y = 5, create a program that outputs the
result of the formula f = (a - b)(x - y) using a single printf() function.

2. Create a program that uses the same formula above to output the result;
this time, however, prompt the user for the values a, b, x, and y.
Use appropriate variable names and naming conventions. 

3. Create a program that prompts a user for her name.
Store the user’s name using the scanf() function and return a
greeting back to the user using her name.

4. Create a new program that prompts a user for numbers
and determines total revenue using the following formula:

5. Build a new program that prompts a user for data and determines
